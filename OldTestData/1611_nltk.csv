Since many of the supplies are consumable. they may need to
be replenished as the year progresses. All extra supplies will
be stored and distributed as needed throughout the year.
Please do not put your child's name on any of the supplies
(only notebooks and folders). as we are trying to create a
sharing community.
Cluster teachers will also request supplies at the beginning of
the year.
