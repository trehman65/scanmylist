Welcome to Kindergarten
Below you will find a list of supplies that your child will need for the school year.
Please remember that all classes use community supplies so several items will be
"shared amongst the class. Please DO NOT write your child's name on any supplies, as"
we will be making personal labels for your child's supplies. We will start collecting
the items on September. The only thing that should be in your child's backpack on
the first day of school is a 2 pocket PLASTIC folder.
