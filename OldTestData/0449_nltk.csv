The Music Streamer Pro is a high performance music
interface (USB connected DAC) that allows a computer and a
professional audio system to become perfect partners. With its
unique topology the Music Streamer Pro provides a
completely isolated path between the computer and the audio
system. No more contamination of the analog signal by the
"computer environment; no matter the situation, the results will"
always be their best. There are no external power supplies to
worry about because the Music Streamer Pro derives its power
from the USB buss while completely regenerating power for all
its internal needs using a sophisticated set of proprietary
circuits.,circuits,Multiple,
Operation is simple: just plug the Music Streamer Pro into any
USB port on the host computer and the Music Streamer Pro
will install itself and be ready for use in a matter of moments.
